# Welcome

Welcome to this 2-day NDC Docker & Kubernetes workshop, this page will guide you through ensuring you have the pre-requisites installed and ready before the start of the workshop.
The workshop is a combination of instructor led presentations combined with attendee hands-on exercises with ample opportunities to ask questions.

**Note**: To avoid issues with corporate IT policies if possible please bring a personal laptop with you. For remote workshop attendees 2 screens are particularly helpful and ideally microphone and camera.

## Hardware requirements

PC with support for virtualisation (e.g. Windows 10 Pro with Hyper-V enabled) or if you're Windows 10 2004 you should be able to use Windows 10 Home configured to work with Docker Desktop (https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install-windows-home/).

Mac (note: Workshop will be run using Windows so some commands may need to be adapted)

## Accounts
An Azure account (preferably a personal account/MSDN account) or a free trial (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/). If you are using a work subscription please ensure you have permissions to create resources such as managed identities/service principals.
