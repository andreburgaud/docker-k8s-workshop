# Kubernetes basics

These exercises require `kubectl` to be installed and access to the Docker Kubenernetes cluster

Ensure that Kubernetes is enabled and the cluster is started

### Kubectl context

The docker tooling should have create a context for the kubectl command to work.
To confirm this you can check the current context:

```txt
kubectl config current-context
```

You should see `docker-desktop`

If it says something else you can set the context by typing

```cmd
kubectl config use-context docker-desktop
```

## Exploring the cluster and nodes

We can explore the cluster using a few commands

```txt
kubectl cluster-info
```
You should see some basic cluster-info

We can see what nodes we have in the cluster with

```txt
kubectl get nodes
```

If we want more information about a node we can `describe` it

```txt
kubectl describe node docker-desktop
```

We should see some detailed output for the node. Take a moment to inspect this output there is a lot of useful information in here

### node labels

Labels are key-value pairs which can be associated with many Kubernetes resources. They allow you to set metadata and also use that meta data in selectors to filter and node labels in particular can be used to help the Kubernetes scheduler place pods on certain nodes

Label the node with a label

```txt
kubectl label node docker-desktop envir1=workshop
```

Describe the node again and confirm you label is now visible

You can remove a label by calling

```txt
kubectl label node docker-desktop envir1-
```

### Events

We can see events happening in the cluster using

```txt
kubectl get events
```

> Note: there may not be any events in your cluster yet - especially if it's new.

### Pods

Pods are the resource which encapsulates your container.
We can use the same pattern of verbs & nouns to list and describe pods.

To run a pod (it will actually create a deployment - we'll cover this later) we can use

```txt
kubectl create deployment hello-world --image=shahiddev/k8s:1.0
```

This command is creating a deployment (well see more of that later) called "hello-world" using the image `shahiddev/k8s:1.0` which is on the DockerHub 

We can see the deployment we've just created by running

```txt
kubectl get deployments
```

Tasks

1. Using similar syntax used for the node list the pods that are running and get more information about them
2. Add a label to the pod called with the key *podnum* and value of *1* (we'll make use of this in the Filtering section)

We'll learn more about scaling later but for now lets scale up the number of pods

```txt
kubectl scale deployment/hello-world --replicas=3
```

This commands tells Kubernetes to scale the deployment called hello-world up to 3 replicas

Tasks

1. Confirm you can see 3 instances of the pod
2. Get the deployments - what's changed about the deployments?


### Filtering

We can use label selectors to filter against specific resources.

In this example we can use the label we added in one the previous tasks to filter the pods

```txt
kubectl get pods -l podnum=1
```

The `-l` is a label selector and here passing in the key and the expected value

You should see the list of pods is filtered down to a single pod - the one you created first

Tasks

1. Filter the pods to show you only those pods which don't have a label called *podnum* with a value of 1 (hint: you only need to add a single character to the label selector value podnum=1)

2. Add the *podnum* label to **one of the other pods** with a value **2**
3. Filter

We can use label selectors to filter a set of pods based on their labels

For example

```txt
kubectl get pods -l "podnum in (1, 2)"
```

This will list the pods which have the label podnum and value either 1 or 2

We can also filter pods to those that have a podnum label applied (irrespective of their values)

```txt
kubectl get pods -l podnum
```

Alternatively those pods that do not have a podnum label

```txt
kubectl get pods -l !podnum
```
**Note:** On Mac/Linux you may have an issue with `kubectl get pods -l !podnum` try putting single quotes around the `!podnum` which should resolve the issue. There are more complex label selectors possible and usually you would want to enclose those in quotes (double quotes on Windows, single on Mac/Linux) 

You can find more examples of label selectors in the docs:

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/

### Container logs

We can inspect the logs of a container by using

```txt
kubectl logs <podname>
```

We can follow the logs by adding `-f` (ctrl + c breaks you out of the follow)

Tasks

1. Run a container of your choosing and inspect the deployment
2. Bring up the logs from that container

### Clean up

We can delete the deployment using:

```txt
kubectl delete deployment/hello-world
```

> Note: you can reference deployments using the syntax `deployments/hello-world` or `deployments hello-world` or `deployment hello-world` they should all give the same result

**Don't forget to also clean up any additional deployments you created in the tasks for this section.**

## Takeaways

* Kubernetes CLI has a fairly consistent syntax for working with resources
* We can quickly run a container and scale it using imperative command line actions
* Labels allow for metadata to be added to many resources
* Label selectors allow us to filter resources based on the labels and/or their values
