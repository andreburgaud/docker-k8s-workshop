# Deployments and more

## Introduction

In the previous section we explored the basic CLI concepts, in this section we'll focus a little more on deployments and the related features/components.


## Deployments

In the previous exercise we created a deployment, let's do that again

```txt
kubectl create deployment hello-world --image=shahiddev/k8s:1.0
```

We can edit that deployment *in situ* using the edit command (please note this isn't something you should be doing in real-life but it's useful to know )

```txt
kubectl edit deployment hello-world
```

This will pop open Notepad (on Windows) and show you the definition of the deployment stored in Kubernetes in YAML format. The command line is blocked waiting for you to either make a change to the deployment or to close it without saving

If you close notepad without making any changes you should see

```txt
>kubectl edit deployment hello-world
Edit cancelled, no changes made.
```

### Tasks

1. Edit the deployment and change the scale of the deployment. Confirm the deployment has scaled in the CLI
2. Edit the deployment to add a label to the deployment called *deployment* with value of "1" (quotes are important) and filter deployments based on this label in the CLI

### Generating manifest files

So far we've run imperative commands however should really use the manifest files in Kubernetes.

To generate the manifest file for a deployment we can use a shortcut (ensure you delete your existing hello-world deployment before continuing)

```txt
kubectl create deployment hello-world --image=shahiddev/k8s:1.0 --dry-run=client -o yaml > helloworld-deployment.yaml
```

The `--dry-run` flag tells Kubernetes to only validate the deployment request but not create it

`-o yaml > helloworld-deployment.yaml` outputs the result in yaml and pipes it to a file.

We can then deploy this manifest file using:

```txt
kubectl apply -f helloworld-deployment.yaml
```

the `-f` flag indicates you are using a file.

This should create a deployment although we may see an warning:

```txt
Warning: kubectl apply should be used on resource created by either kubectl create --save-config or kubectl apply
```

This is due to the presence of some empty fields in the deployment yaml, you would normally remove them before applying for now we can ignore the warning.

We can make changes to this deployment file and simply run the `kubectl apply` command again to update the deployment with the latest values.

### Tasks

1. Open the yaml file in an editor (VS code ideally) and take a look at what's generated.
2. Edit the yaml to change the scale and update the deployment by re-applying the updated file.

## Expose services

So far we've deployed this web application but we've not yet connected to it in the browser.

To expose applications externally we need to create a service

We can do this imperative as before 

```txt
kubectl expose deployment hello-world --port=80 --type=LoadBalancer
```

This creates a service to allow external traffic to access the application pods. In docker-desktop this simply means the application will be accessible on localhost:80

On a cloud platform a `loadBalancer` service will request a public ip address and cloud load balancer from the cloud provider.

You can check the public ip address of the service by running

```txt
kubectl get svc
```

>When running in the Cloud it will take a few minutes for the LoadBalancer service to create a public IP address

### Task

Create and save the manifest files for the deployment and service so we can use them in next exercise
