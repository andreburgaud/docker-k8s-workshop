# Using AKS

## Setup the cluster

We will be using the Azure CLI to create/interact with AKS so we need to ensure we are setup correctly.

You can list the subscriptions you have access to using:

```txt
az account list -o table
```

**Ensure the IsDefault is true for the account you want to use for this exercise**

If you need to change the default you can do this with:

```txt
az account set -s <subscriptionId>
```

We may need to register the container services resource provider and storage resource provider

To check if you need to register the resource provider you can run:

```txt
az provider show -n Microsoft.ContainerService --query "registrationState"
az provider show -n Microsoft.Storage --query "registrationState"
```

If you do not see *"Registered"* for all of these resource providers then you will need to register the missing provider using the relevant command below - if your provider is already registered you can jump straight to creating the cluster

```txt
az provider register -n Microsoft.ContainerService
az provider register -n Microsoft.Storage
```

The registration of the provider happens in the background so we need to check it has succeeded before continuing - it can take a few minutes to complete (check the status periodically)

```txt
az provider show -n Microsoft.ContainerService --query "registrationState"
az provider show -n Microsoft.Storage --query "registrationState"
```

### Creating the cluster

First we create the resource group

```cmd
az group create -n k8s-workshoprg -l eastus2
```

We can now create our cluster

```txt
az aks create -n k8s-workshop -g k8s-workshoprg -k 1.15.11 -s Standard_D2s_v3 -c 2 --vm-set-type VirtualMachineScaleSets --enable-managed-identity --generate-ssh-keys --location eastus2
```

We are leaving the rest of the options default - in this command we are specifying the K8s version we want and 2 nodes using the VMSS approach (rather than availability sets) and we're telling Azure to create and manage a service principal identity for us. 

This operation usually takes between 6-10 mins to complete but can take up to 15-20

If you're having problems with this CLI approach you may want to use the portal to create the cluster.
