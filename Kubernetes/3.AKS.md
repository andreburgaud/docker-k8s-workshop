# Using AKS

## Setup the cluster

If you haven't already done so - ensure you're AKS cluster is created by following the [steps here](0.Create-AKS-cluster.md)

If you're waiting for the cluster to provisioned, in a new terminal you can explore the `az aks` commands to see how you would change the number nodes you create & vm types. **Don't create a new cluster though**

Once the cluster is created we need to gain access to the cluster we can use the `get-credentials` subcommand of the `az aks`

```txt
az aks get-credentials -n k8s-workshop -g k8s-workshoprg
```

This will get the credentials for the cluster and create/merge a context in the kubeconfig file and set it as the active context

> The kubeconfig file is an important file, it is used to store the details and credentials of the clusters you have access to. 
> By default this config file is created in your home directory under a .kube folder (e.g. c:\users\<yourname>\.kube)

Running this command should display the context pointing to the cluster we've just provisioned.

```txt
kubectl config current-context
```

If you wanted to switch back to the docker cluster you can switch context

```txt
kubectl config use-context docker-desktop
```

You can explore the different contexts that are in your kubeconfig file by running

```txt
kubectl config get-contexts
```

If you have setup your AKS cluster and Docker desktop you should see at least 3 entries (docker seems to add 2 contexts).
Note the asterisk shows you the currently selected context.

## Deploying applications

You can follow the same imperative commands used in earlier exercises to deploy the same web application to AKS. However we want to promote good practices so you should deploy the application using the manifest file created in earlier exercises

### Tasks

1. Explore the cluster and nodes on AKS and compare them to what you saw with docker-desktop
2. Deploy the hello-world application
3. Expose the hello-world application publicly using a service manifest file (create one if you don't already have one - hint --dry-run may help create it). Watch the service resource to see when it has a public IP address.
4. Manually scale the application and note where pods are created (hint you can use `kubectl get pods -o wide` to show you the node names where pods are running)
5. Scale down the application - which pods are removed?
6. Add a liveness probe to the deployment manifest file (hint: the shahiddev/k8s image has a http health endpoint at /home/health) to test this if you hit the url  `http://<service ip>/home/setunhealthy` and you should see a message and you can confirm a pod was restarted by inspecting the restarts column when you get pods.
7. Perform a rolling update to v2 image and explore the impact of changing the `maxunavailable` and `maxsurge` fields (hint: You may need to add the rolling update strategy to the deployment yaml)


### Optional tasks

There are sample manifest files in the solutions folder for configMaps and Secrets use those to understand how you can create and use these components.

8. Explore ConfigMaps and how you can use these to pass configuration to your containers via environment variables. Start by getting configmaps from your cluster using `kubectl` and explore using commands such as `describe`
9. Secrets - Similar to config maps but used for sensitive information. Start by getting secrets from your cluster using `kubectl` and explore using commands such as `describe`
