or
Mac (note: Workshop will be run using Windows so some commands may need to be slightly adapted)

## Software

On Windows we recommend using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install) to install the software you require, although the links below will allow you to install the software using the product's installer.

* Docker for Windows (or Mac) - https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop (to minimise any issues please install stable channel)
* Git - https://git-scm.com/downloads
* Visual Studio 2017/19 (incl. Free Community Edition) - https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/ or Visual Studio Code - https://code.visualstudio.com/

## Accounts

A DockerHub account (free) - https://hub.docker.com/signup 

**Note**: If you  created a DockerHub account before April 25th 2019, please ensure you've recently changed your password due to [April 2019 security breach](https://success.docker.com/article/docker-hub-user-notification)

Azure account - If you have access to an Azure subscription for those exercises that require it please be prepared to use this. Alternative you can sign up to a free trial (https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) (this requires a credit card to sign up). Please contact the workshop organiser ASAP if you are unable to access an Azure account.

If you would prefer to use an alternative managed Kubernetes service you are welcome to so so,although some of the hands-on exercises may not be applicable (e.g. setting up AKS). The workshop organiser(s) will try and support all managed Kubernetes services but cannot gaurantee this.
